An electorde was taped to a patients forehead, in simplistic terms this electrode measures the brain activity and gives us a number (BIS) that gives us information about how deeply a patient is anesthetised. Electroncephalogram (EEG) data alongside with a few other parameters (SQI-Signal quality, EMG-electromyogram, BSR-Burst supression rate)are recorded. For the purposes of this study a program was developed that recorded not only the mentioned parameters but all biological signals that are monitored during a surgery: Oxygen saturation in blood (SpO2), EEG Frequency, Hearth rate (HR), ECG (ST II), capnography (erCO2),MAC (minimum alveolar concentration in the case inhalational anesthestic would be used). Relevant parameters (BIS, EMG, SQI, BSR)were recorded every 5 seconds, all the other parameters were recorded every second. This study compares two electrodes, a standard one and a newone, generic one. The purpose of the analysis is to assess the quality of a new generic equipment.\n","- Analysis of historical damage data on agricultural crops in Italy to contribute to pricing models for a natural disaster insurance company \n","- Analysis of 250'000 Switchin Cycles of a Vacuum Circuit Breaker (VCB) to know how many switching cycles have been done under which condition (pneumatic pressure, control Voltage).\n","- Analysis of certified B corporations, companies that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"nApT7StLPy5F"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T09slmItQKFO"},"source":["# Imports\n","\n","TODO: if you are using libraries that were not introduced during the course, explain in a comment what you are using the library for.\n","\n","<font color='orange'>WARNING</font>: not all Python libraries are safe to use.
